# Prologue

*“Failure isn’t an optionbecause they won’t see us coming.”*  

The ST Head, gripping a coffee mug tightly, muttered to himself as he paced the room. But his words, though meant for himself, were heard by everyone.  

This was no ordinary plan. It was a high-stakes operation where every step had to be calculated with surgical precision. One mistake could shatter everything. Failure was not an option.  

Silence swallowed the room. The team’s breaths were shallow, their nerves frayed, but the ST Head stood unwavering. He had devised a foolproof plan, accounting for every possibility, every risk. Now, all that was left was to execute it, and execution would mean walking a razor-thin line between brilliance and disaster.

"We go by the numbers," the ST Head said, his voice cutting through the heavy air. “No improvisation. No second guesses.” He paused, his gaze hard and unrelenting as it swept across the team. "We can’t afford it."

The clock on the wall ticked louder than it should have. Tick. Tick. Tick. Time... merciless and unforgiving was slipping through their fingers.

The ST Head stopped pacing and looked at the center screen, where the live feed of the Cousinology Channel played. Bright, oblivious smiles filled the screen, the kind that made his stomach turn. They had no idea. Not yet. But soon...

Time was ticking, and the Cousinology Channel life was about to change. They were unaware of what was coming.

# Introduction

The morning sun cast a warm glow over She Beauty Salon, its photo covered glass doors gleaming like a beacon of tranquility amidst the hustle of the neighborhood. Inside, the hum of hair dryers blended seamlessly with the soft music that played in the background. Customers sat in sleek chairs, chatting amicably over cups of spiced chai while stylists worked their magic with brushes and scissors.  

Behind the main counter stood Sadaf, the owner of the salon. Her composed demeanor and warm smile made her the heart of the place. She was dressed in the most modern clothes possible, exuding an effortless grace. Sadaf was well-loved, not just by her staff, but by the regulars who visited her salon. She was known for her sharp business acumen and her unflinching kindness, qualities that had made She Beauty Salon a trusted name in the community.  

“Zara, don't forget to check the inventory before you leave,” Sadaf reminded one of her senior staff members, her voice calm yet firm. “We've got a big shipment coming tomorrow, and I don't want any surprises.”  

Zara nodded, a smile on her lips. “Don't worry, Sadaf Aapi. I've got it covered.”  

Sadaf moved effortlessly between her roles as manager and confidante. She stopped by a customer getting her hair dyed, offering a friendly compliment on the choice of color, and then exchanged a laugh with another stylist who had accidentally dropped a comb. It was just another typical day... or so it seemed.  

At the far end of the room, a faint vibration from her phone caught her attention. She reached for it and smiled when she saw the caller ID: Ali.  

“Hello, Ali. What's up?” she said, leaning against the counter as she took the call.  

“Nothing,” Ali replied, his tone laced with indifference. “Just checking in. You need me to pick anything up today?”  

A soft sigh escaped her lips. Ali had been aimless lately... no college, no job, no real direction. Despite her subtle nudges and encouragement, he seemed content to drift. But as a mother, she held on to the hope that he'd find his way, eventually.  

“No, beta. I'll manage,” she said gently. “But it's good to hear from you. Are you okay?”  

“I'm fine, Ammi,” he replied. “Just... bored, I guess.”  

Sadaf smiled to herself. “Well, come visit the salon if you're that bored. You can help me keep the place running,” she teased.  

Ali chuckled faintly. “Sure, maybe.”  

Their conversation ended shortly after, and Sadaf placed her phone back on the counter. For a brief moment, her expression softened, a flicker of concern crossing her features. But she quickly composed herself, turning her attention back to the salon.  

The day stretched on with its usual rhythm... appointments kept, conversations shared, and a steady stream of customers coming and going. The salon was a sanctuary, a haven of normalcy. But beyond its glass doors, an unseen shadow loomed, waiting for the perfect moment to disrupt their peace.  

For now, She Beauty Salon remained a picture of harmony. But the calm would not last.

Inside the salon, the atmosphere was calm yet busy as the staff tidied up for the night. The faint scent of hair products lingered in the air, and the soft hum of a vacuum cleaner broke the silence.  

Sadaf stood by the cash register, her fingers dancing over the keys as she tallied up the day's earnings. She glanced at the clock on the wall... 9:15 p.m. Just a few more minutes, and she'd lock up. Zara, the senior stylist, was wiping down the mirrors, while two other staff members swept the floor, chatting about their plans for the weekend.  

“Let's wrap it up, girls,” Sadaf said, her voice warm but firm. “It's been a long day.”  

The others nodded, their movements brisk but relaxed. Outside, a soft rumble of an engine echoed faintly, followed by the screech of brakes. None of them noticed.  

The white van came to a halt just outside the salon. Its doors opened in unison, and six women stepped out, their faces obscured by masks. They moved with practiced precision, their footsteps almost silent on the pavement.  

Inside the van, a team member tapped a tablet, hacking into the area's CCTV feed. The screen flickered, and the live footage of the salon and the area around went dark. The team exchanged nods before two of them pushed open the salon's glass doors.  

The door chimed softly as the masked women entered, drawing the attention of Zara, who looked up from her cleaning.  

“We're closed,” Zara said politely, gesturing toward the door.  

One of the women ignored her, reaching out to lock the door with a decisive *click*. The sound sent a chill through the room, and Sadaf turned sharply toward the entrance, her instincts immediately on edge.  

“What's going on?” Sadaf demanded, stepping forward.  

Before anyone could react, the team moved. One of them lunged at Zara, forcing her against the wall, while another grabbed one of the younger staff members, covering her mouth to stifle her scream.  

“Don't fight, and no one gets hurt,” one of the masked women said coldly, her voice devoid of emotion.  

But panic had already set in. The younger staff member struggled, kicking over a chair in the process, while Zara clawed at her attacker's arms. Sadaf rushed forward, trying to intervene, but a third intruder blocked her path, shoving her back against the counter.  

“Leave them alone!” Sadaf cried out, her voice trembling with anger and fear.  

The room erupted into chaos. A mirror shattered as Zara was shoved into it, shards scattering across the floor. Another worker let out a muffled cry as she was dragged toward the back of the salon. The invaders were methodical, their movements swift and calculated.  

Sadaf grabbed a heavy object... a pair of scissors... swung it toward the nearest attacker. But her wrist was caught mid-swing, and the scissors clattered to the ground.  

“Stupid move,” the woman muttered before striking Sadaf across the face. Sadaf stumbled, clutching her cheek as she fell to her knees.  

One by one, the workers were subdued. Zip ties secured their hands, and duct tape muffled their cries. Zara lay on the floor, her lip split and blood staining her cheek. The others sat huddled together, trembling as the masked women loomed over them.  

Sadaf, her breathing ragged, looked up at the intruders. “Please,” she begged. “Don't hurt them. Take whatever you want, but don't hurt them.”  

The leader of the group crouched down, meeting Sadaf's eyes. “We don't want your money,” she said, her voice calm yet icy. “We want *something else*.”  

Before Sadaf could process the words, she was hauled to her feet and shoved toward the door. The others were dragged out as well, their muffled cries swallowed by the stillness of the night.  

As the team began loading Sadaf and her staff into the van, the sound of a phone ringing broke the silence. Everyone froze. The intruders exchanged alarmed glances before one of them moved quickly toward the counter, rummaging through Sadaf's belongings.  

“It's hers,” one of them hissed, silencing the phone and pocketing it.  

“Let's move,” the leader barked, her voice sharper now.  

The van doors slammed shut, and the vehicle sped off into the night, leaving behind a salon that, despite its orderly appearance, now held no trace of the chaos that had just unfolded. It disappeared into the darkness, leaving the salon eerily quiet. Inside, the ST sprang into action. They moved with precision, their every motion calculated.  

---

Later that night the team came back and the their female lead orders them in a low voice. “Sweep the place. Nothing out of place. Make it look like business as usual.”  

Two team members began cleaning up the signs of struggle. The shattered mirror was carefully replaced with a spare one stored in the back. Bloodstains on the tiles were wiped away with a disinfectant-soaked rag, the scent of ammonia filling the air. A toppled chair was righted and dusted off. The salon chairs gleamed under the fluorescent lights as if they had been untouched.  

One of the intruders ran a gloved hand over the counter, picking up stray hairpins and discarded receipts, while another rearranged the display of beauty products. Within an hour, the salon looked as serene as it had before the attack.  

In the breakroom at the back, several team members swapped their tactical attire for casual uniforms resembling the ones worn by the original salon staff. They tied aprons around their waists and adjusted their headscarves to blend in.  

“Remember,” the leader said, her voice firm. “You're just workers. Smile if anyone comes in. Answer questions, but keep it brief. No one should suspect a thing.”  

Another member tested the security of the locked doors, ensuring no one could enter the restricted areas they were now setting up as their base.  

At the counter, one of the team members held Sadaf's phone. Her fingers flew over the screen, typing out a message:  
*“I'm heading out of town for work. Won't be reachable for a while. Don't worry, {Asim}.”*  

The message was sent, and a copy was forwarded to other family members in Sadaf's contact list.  

“Believable,” one of the team members murmured.  

“Now for the voice,” another replied, holding up a device. It emitted a low hum as the team member practiced mimicking Sadaf's voice. “This is Sadaf, I'll be out of town for a bit. Call me only in case of emergencies,” the voice said, its tone almost indistinguishable from the real Sadaf.  

“Perfect,” the leader said with a satisfied nod.  

The real work began in the storage room at the back of the salon. The team unloaded equipment from the van: surveillance cameras, microphones, and a compact but powerful computer system.  

One of the team members adjusted a hidden camera, ensuring it had a clear view of the salon floor. Another placed a tiny microphone inside a decorative vase by the counter.  

“This will be our nerve center,” the leader explained, gesturing to the setup. “From here, we'll track every move the [Cusinology Channel] members make.”  

The team worked silently but efficiently, the glow of computer screens illuminating their determined faces.  

---

The next afternoon, Ali, Alizah, and Alisha arrived at the salon. The siblings looked worried, their faces etched with concern.  

“Where's Ammi?” Ali asked, his voice sharp as he scanned the familiar surroundings.  

One of the disguised workers stepped forward, her expression calm. “Sadaf aapi went out of the city for some work. She mentioned it last night. Didn't she tell you?”  

Ali exchanged a glance with his sisters. “She didn't say anything,” Alizah murmured, her voice laced with doubt.  

The worker smiled politely. “She seemed in a hurry. But she said she'd call when she could.”  

Alisha, frowning, pulled out her phone. “Let me call her,” she said.  

The siblings waited as Alisha dialed. The familiar ringtone of Sadaf's phone echoed through the salon, loud and unmistakable.  

Ali froze, his eyes darting to the counter where the sound was coming from. The worker's mask of composure faltered for the briefest moment.    

# Cracks in the Facade  

The piercing sound of the ringtone reverberated through the salon, freezing everyone in place. Ali, Alizah, and Alisha exchanged alarmed glances as their mother’s unmistakable ringtone echoed from behind the counter.  

For a moment, time seemed to stand still. The supposed workers... the ST members disguised in aprons and casual uniforms, stole panicked glances at each other. Their bodies tensed, their eyes betraying the calm masks they desperately tried to maintain.  

One of them, quick-witted and composed under pressure, stepped forward. She forced a smile, though her voice carried a slight edge as she said, “Oh! That’s Sadaf aapi’s old phone. She left it here earlier. You know how forgetful she can be sometimes!”  

Her tone was light, almost dismissive, as if the situation were perfectly normal. The siblings frowned, their unease evident, but the worker didn’t give them time to question. She reached behind the counter, pulled out the ringing phone, and silenced it with a casual press of a button.  

Another ST member joined in, feigning annoyance with a huff. “She’s always leaving her stuff behind,” she said, rolling her eyes. “You wouldn’t believe how often we have to remind her. Just the other day, she left her charger too!”  

The faintest tremor betrayed the first worker’s hand as she tucked the phone into her apron pocket. She forced another laugh and turned her attention back to Ali, Alizah, and Alisha.  

“By the way,” she added smoothly, “Sadaf aapi said she’d call later when she’s settled. She’s really busy with her work trip right now.”  

Ali crossed his arms, his eyes narrowing. “She didn’t mention anything about a trip. When exactly did she leave?”  

The worker hesitated for the briefest second, but her companion jumped in to cover. “Late last night,” she said confidently. “She barely had time to grab her things. She was in such a rush, she even forgot her phone here.”  

Alizah wasn’t convinced. Her gaze darted between the workers and the familiar surroundings of the salon. Something felt off. The air, usually filled with warmth and cheer, now carried an uneasy chill.  

“Can we look around?” Alisha asked, her voice uncertain but firm.  

The supposed worker’s smile faltered slightly. “There’s really nothing to see,” she said quickly. “Everything’s the same as it always is.”  

Ali, ignoring the comment, stepped toward the back of the salon. One of the ST members casually shifted to block his path, picking up a broom and pretending to sweep.  

“Sorry,” the worker said, her tone overly polite. “This area’s restricted right now. We’re doing some cleaning.”  

Ali’s jaw tightened. “Since when is the back of the salon restricted?”  

“Just today,” the worker replied with a too-bright smile. “You know how it is with Sadaf aapi gone. We’re reorganizing things to keep the place running smoothly.”  

The siblings exchanged glances, their suspicion growing. Alizah noticed a faint bead of sweat roll down the worker’s neck as she turned away, pretending to straighten a display of hair products.  

Ali took a step closer to the counter. “Why would she leave without telling us?” he pressed. “That doesn’t sound like her at all.”  

The worker hesitated, her hand tightening around the edge of the counter. “Maybe she didn’t want to worry you,” she said finally, her voice softening as if to sound reassuring. “You know how much she cares about you three.”  

Alisha’s phone vibrated in her hand, interrupting the tense silence. She glanced at the screen and saw a notification from their family group chat... Sadaf’s earlier message about being out of town.  

“She texted us,” Alisha murmured, though her voice was tinged with doubt.  

Sensing the rising tension, another worker chimed in with a forced laugh. “Look, you don’t have to worry. Sadaf aapi is fine. She’ll call you when she can. Now, why don’t you three go home and rest? She wouldn’t want you stressing over nothing.”  

Ali hesitated, his fists clenching at his sides. Every fiber of his being told him something was wrong, but without concrete proof, what could he do?  

“Let’s go,” Alizah said quietly, tugging at her brother’s arm. “We’ll figure this out later.”  

Reluctantly, Ali allowed himself to be led out of the salon, his eyes darting back to the workers who watched them go. As the glass door swung shut, he turned to his sisters.  

“This isn’t over,” he said firmly.  

The ST members let out a collective breath as the trio disappeared down the street. The leader of the group stepped out from the back room, her eyes narrowing.  

“That was too close,” she muttered.  

“We need to tighten security,” another member added. “They’re suspicious.”  

The leader nodded, her jaw set. “We’ll handle it. But for now, focus. This operation doesn’t fail.”  

In the quiet salon, the faint hum of hidden surveillance equipment buzzed ominously, a reminder of the stakes that hung over everyone involved.
