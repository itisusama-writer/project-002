# Cracks in the Facade  

The piercing sound of the ringtone reverberated through the salon, freezing everyone in place. Ali, Alizah, and Alisha exchanged alarmed glances as their mother’s unmistakable ringtone echoed from behind the counter.  

For a moment, time seemed to stand still. The supposed workers... the ST members disguised in aprons and casual uniforms, stole panicked glances at each other. Their bodies tensed, their eyes betraying the calm masks they desperately tried to maintain.  

One of them, quick-witted and composed under pressure, stepped forward. She forced a smile, though her voice carried a slight edge as she said, “Oh! That’s Sadaf aapi’s old phone. She left it here earlier. You know how forgetful she can be sometimes!”  

Her tone was light, almost dismissive, as if the situation were perfectly normal. The siblings frowned, their unease evident, but the worker didn’t give them time to question. She reached behind the counter, pulled out the ringing phone, and silenced it with a casual press of a button.  

Another ST member joined in, feigning annoyance with a huff. “She’s always leaving her stuff behind,” she said, rolling her eyes. “You wouldn’t believe how often we have to remind her. Just the other day, she left her charger too!”  

The faintest tremor betrayed the first worker’s hand as she tucked the phone into her apron pocket. She forced another laugh and turned her attention back to Ali, Alizah, and Alisha.  

“By the way,” she added smoothly, “Sadaf aapi said she’d call later when she’s settled. She’s really busy with her work trip right now.”  

Ali crossed his arms, his eyes narrowing. “She didn’t mention anything about a trip. When exactly did she leave?”  

The worker hesitated for the briefest second, but her companion jumped in to cover. “Late last night,” she said confidently. “She barely had time to grab her things. She was in such a rush, she even forgot her phone here.”  

Alizah wasn’t convinced. Her gaze darted between the workers and the familiar surroundings of the salon. Something felt off. The air, usually filled with warmth and cheer, now carried an uneasy chill.  

“Can we look around?” Alisha asked, her voice uncertain but firm.  

The supposed worker’s smile faltered slightly. “There’s really nothing to see,” she said quickly. “Everything’s the same as it always is.”  

Ali, ignoring the comment, stepped toward the back of the salon. One of the ST members casually shifted to block his path, picking up a broom and pretending to sweep.  

“Sorry,” the worker said, her tone overly polite. “This area’s restricted right now. We’re doing some cleaning.”  

Ali’s jaw tightened. “Since when is the back of the salon restricted?”  

“Just today,” the worker replied with a too-bright smile. “You know how it is with Sadaf aapi gone. We’re reorganizing things to keep the place running smoothly.”  

The siblings exchanged glances, their suspicion growing. Alizah noticed a faint bead of sweat roll down the worker’s neck as she turned away, pretending to straighten a display of hair products.  

Ali took a step closer to the counter. “Why would she leave without telling us?” he pressed. “That doesn’t sound like her at all.”  

The worker hesitated, her hand tightening around the edge of the counter. “Maybe she didn’t want to worry you,” she said finally, her voice softening as if to sound reassuring. “You know how much she cares about you three.”  

Alisha’s phone vibrated in her hand, interrupting the tense silence. She glanced at the screen and saw a notification from their family group chat... Sadaf’s earlier message about being out of town.  

“She texted us,” Alisha murmured, though her voice was tinged with doubt.  

Sensing the rising tension, another worker chimed in with a forced laugh. “Look, you don’t have to worry. Sadaf aapi is fine. She’ll call you when she can. Now, why don’t you three go home and rest? She wouldn’t want you stressing over nothing.”  

Ali hesitated, his fists clenching at his sides. Every fiber of his being told him something was wrong, but without concrete proof, what could he do?  

“Let’s go,” Alizah said quietly, tugging at her brother’s arm. “We’ll figure this out later.”  

Reluctantly, Ali allowed himself to be led out of the salon, his eyes darting back to the workers who watched them go. As the glass door swung shut, he turned to his sisters.  

“This isn’t over,” he said firmly.  

The ST members let out a collective breath as the trio disappeared down the street. The leader of the group stepped out from the back room, her eyes narrowing.  

“That was too close,” she muttered.  

“We need to tighten security,” another member added. “They’re suspicious.”  

The leader nodded, her jaw set. “We’ll handle it. But for now, focus. This operation doesn’t fail.”  

In the quiet salon, the faint hum of hidden surveillance equipment buzzed ominously, a reminder of the stakes that hung over everyone involved.
