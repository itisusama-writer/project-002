# Prologue

*“Failure isn’t an optionbecause they won’t see us coming.”*  

The ST Head, gripping a coffee mug tightly, muttered to himself as he paced the room. But his words, though meant for himself, were heard by everyone.  

This was no ordinary plan. It was a high-stakes operation where every step had to be calculated with surgical precision. One mistake could shatter everything. Failure was not an option.  

Silence swallowed the room. The team’s breaths were shallow, their nerves frayed, but the ST Head stood unwavering. He had devised a foolproof plan, accounting for every possibility, every risk. Now, all that was left was to execute it, and execution would mean walking a razor-thin line between brilliance and disaster.

"We go by the numbers," the ST Head said, his voice cutting through the heavy air. “No improvisation. No second guesses.” He paused, his gaze hard and unrelenting as it swept across the team. "We can’t afford it."

The clock on the wall ticked louder than it should have. Tick. Tick. Tick. Time... merciless and unforgiving was slipping through their fingers.

The ST Head stopped pacing and looked at the center screen, where the live feed of the Cousinology Channel played. Bright, oblivious smiles filled the screen, the kind that made his stomach turn. They had no idea. Not yet. But soon...

Time was ticking, and the Cousinology Channel life was about to change. They were unaware of what was coming.
