### Chapter 3: The Shadow Grows  

The evening sun dipped low, casting long shadows over the street. Opposite the She Beauty Salon, the house belonging to the Cousinology Channel team stood quietly, its unassuming exterior betraying nothing of the vibrant activity it usually held within. But from the salon, concealed cameras and hidden microphones had been calibrated to pick up every sound, every movement.  

Inside the salon, the ST team worked in silence, their actions precise and synchronized. The leader stood in the makeshift operations room—a once modest storage area now filled with monitors and communication devices. Each screen displayed a feed from the house across the street: the front door, the living room, even the faint glow of a laptop in a bedroom.  

“Update me,” the leader ordered, her voice sharp.  

One of the team members turned from her screen. “The targets’ movements are consistent with the routines we’ve observed. They gather in the living room at 8 p.m. every night. Conversations are casual—content planning, video editing, nothing that suggests they’re aware of us.”  

The leader nodded, her expression cold. “Good. Keep monitoring. We’ll move when the time is right.”

**Ali’s Growing Suspicion**  

At a small café a few blocks away, Ali sat with his sisters, Alizah and Alisha. The unease from their earlier visit to the salon lingered like a dark cloud over them.  

“I’m telling you, something’s wrong,” Ali said, his voice low but insistent. He stirred his coffee absently, his eyes fixed on the table.  

“We don’t have proof,” Alizah replied, though her tone was uncertain. “Ammi’s message... it checks out.”  

“Does it?” Ali countered. “Ammi doesn’t just leave without telling us. And those workers—they were acting weird.”  

Alisha nodded slowly. “The phone ringing... that wasn’t normal. And they didn’t even let us see the back of the salon. What are they hiding?”  

Ali leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. “I think we need to start asking questions. Something’s going on, and I’m not letting this go.”

**A Flaw in the Plan**  

Back at the salon, the leader noticed a minor flicker on one of the screens—a lag in the feed from the Cousinology house’s kitchen. She frowned and turned to the tech specialist.  

“What’s that?”  

The specialist tapped a few keys, her brow furrowing. “Minor interference. Could be from their Wi-Fi system. It’s nothing.”  

“Fix it,” the leader snapped. “I don’t want *anything* left to chance.”  

The specialist nodded, but the leader’s unease didn’t dissipate. She had built her reputation on precision, on planning for every contingency. A mistake, even a small one, could ruin everything.

**The Cousinology Team Prepares**  

Inside the house, the Cousinology team—three cousins with an infectious dynamic that had earned them a loyal following—sat in their living room. Their laughter echoed softly as they debated ideas for their next video.  

“We should do a challenge,” one of them suggested. “Something funny but relatable. Like... how about ‘When Your Cousin Steals Your Fries’?”  

The others groaned and laughed, shaking their heads. “No one wants to see that!”  

Unbeknownst to them, their every word was being recorded, analyzed by the ST team.

**A Small Spark**  

As the night deepened, Ali found himself unable to shake the feeling of impending danger. He stared at his phone, scrolling through his mother’s messages. The phrasing felt... off. Too formal. Too unlike her.  

“I’m going back to the salon,” he said abruptly, standing up.  

“What? Now?” Alizah asked, startled.  

“I need to know,” Ali said firmly. “Are you coming or not?”  

Alizah and Alisha exchanged a look before grabbing their coats. “Let’s go.”

**The Stage is Set**  

Inside the salon, the leader was finalizing plans for the next phase of the operation. “We’re on schedule,” she told her team. “Tomorrow, we’ll begin testing the vulnerabilities of the Cousinology house. We need to map every blind spot, every weakness.”  

But as the ST team prepared for their next move, the faint chime of the salon’s front door echoed through the building.  

“They’re back,” one of the team members whispered, glancing at the security feed that displayed Ali, Alizah, and Alisha stepping inside.  

The leader’s eyes narrowed. “Stay calm. Stick to the script. If they’re here to snoop, we’ll make sure they don’t find anything.”

**Cliffhanger**  

Ali stopped just inside the salon, his gaze sweeping over the pristine, too-perfect surroundings. “We’re not leaving until we get answers,” he said, his voice firm.  

The ST team exchanged subtle glances, their masks of calm slipping ever so slightly. Behind the counter, one of the members reached for a hidden button, ready to alert the others.  

The game of cat and mouse had begun, and both sides knew that the slightest misstep could change everything.
