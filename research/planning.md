# Idea:
- An attack will take place on She beauty salon, and it will be converted into the main base from where further plans will be executed.  
- All workers and the owner will be kidnapped and kept in a secret location, while the salon will be controlled by ST members.  
- To keep everything normal, the owner, {Sadaf}, will be shown as out of the city for work. This will be managed by sending fake messages from her phone and mimicking {Sadaf’s} voice so that her family members don’t become suspicious.


# Scene Guide: Chapter 1

**1. Introduction to She Beauty Salon**  
   - Start with a normal day at the She Beauty Salon to contrast the calm atmosphere with the chaos that’s about to unfold.  
   - **Description of the Salon**: Busy yet peaceful. A place where customers chat over cups of tea, workers move briskly, and soft music plays in the background.  
   - **Introduction of {Sadaf}**: Highlight her as a composed, salon owner, a woman loved by both her staff and customers. Briefly mention her son, {Ali}, and show {Sadaf’s} brief interaction with him (a phone call) to establish her personal stakes.

**2. The Attack on the Salon**  
   - Create a scene brimming with tension and precision as the attack unfolds. It was night time and other shopes were closed.  
   - **Scenes to Include**:  
     - The moment just before the attack: customers leave, workers clean up, {Sadaf} perhaps locking the cash register. A false sense of calm. There were no customers at the time of attack.  
     - The arrival of the ST ladies: A white van stop outside the saloon. Doors slam. They entered the Saloon like normal customers with the face mask on. (They hacked the CCTV right before the arrival)  
     - **The Invasion**:  
       - A coordinated entry: ST ladies entered normally with the face mask on through door, one member locked the door and soon the ST overpowering workers with speed and efficiency. Some workers scream; others are frozen in shock. The workers got beaten up and were fumed. 
       - {Sadaf} tries to resist or protect her staff, but she’s quickly subdued. Make this moment emotional—she might call out for {Ali} in desperation.  
       - Use vivid sensory details: breaking glass, muffled cries, the sharp zip of zip ties, and the clattering of overturned furniture.  
     - Team members secure the salon, dragging {Sadaf} and her workers into waiting vehicles.  
     - **Tension Point**: A minor complication arises (e.g., a worker’s phone rings loudly, or someone manages to briefly escape before being recaptured). This adds realism and keeps the reader on edge.

**3. Aftermath and Cover-Up**  
   - Transition to how the ST begins turning the salon into their operational base.  
   - **Scenes to Include**:  
     - Team members clean up any signs of struggle: broken items are fixed, blood from the workers that were beaten is wiped away, and salon chairs are neatly rearranged.
     - ST ladies dressed as a worker so they will keep the place running to make make everything look normal.   
     - A quick cut to a team member using {Sadaf’s} phone to send a believable message: *“I’m heading out of town for work. Won’t be reachable for a while. Don’t worry, {Asim}.”*  
     - A glimpse of their voice mimicry technology as one of the team practices speaking like {Sadaf}.  
   - **Hint at the Future**: Show the team setting up surveillance equipment at the back area of the salon. Hidden cameras, microphones, and computer systems—signaling that this will be their hub for tracking the [Cusinology Channel] members.

**4. Emotional Hook: Focus on {Ali}, {Alizah}, {Alisha}**  
   - End the chapter with a brief shift to {Ali}, {Alizah}, {Alisha} as they went to the saloon to check for their mother but one of the supposed worker said, *"Sadaf aapi went out of city for some work."*.

**5. CLiff Hanger: The phone call**

    - When {Alisha} call her mother, {Sadaf's} phone rang in the saloon

# Scene Guide: Chapter 2

- As {Alisha} calls her mother’s phone, the ringtone suddenly echoes through the salon, freezing everyone in place.  
- The **supposed workers**— ST members—exchange quick, panicked glances. For a brief moment, the atmosphere turns heavy, the tension crackling in the air.  
- One of the ST members, quick-witted and composed under pressure, steps forward with a calm demeanor. She forces a smile and laughs awkwardly to diffuse suspicion.  

   **Dialogue**:  
   *“Oh! That’s Sadaf aapi’s old phone. She left it here earlier. You know how forgetful she can be sometimes!”*  
   - To make the excuse convincing, she casually pulls out the phone from under a counter or shelf, waving it dismissively. She silences the call, shaking her head as if it’s no big deal.  
   - **Action to add realism**: Another team member pipes up, feigning annoyance.  
     *“She’s always leaving her stuff behind. You wouldn’t believe how often we have to call her to remind her!”*  
   - The team subtly shares a nod, their nervous energy masked with practiced nonchalance.  

- {Ali}, {Alizah}, and {Alisha} exchange confused glances but accept the explanation for now, though there’s a hint of unease lingering in their expressions.  
- To further sell the cover-up, the [Secret Team member] quickly pivots the conversation:  
   *“By the way, Sadaf aapi said she’d call later when she’s settled. She’s really busy with her work trip right now.”*  

- **Visual Detail**: A bead of sweat rolls down the supposed worker’s neck as she turns away, back to "work," pretending to sweep or clean while stealing anxious glances at the trio.
